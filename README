A distributed trading system to simulate stock trading.
- Adopted a hybrid of peer-to-peer and client-server architecture, which is the super-peer architecture
- Included key distributed system features: data replication and fault tolerance
- Passed concurrency test of 1,000 clients trading stocks at the same time easily on a laptop

In the data folder, you will see different scenarios, each scenario is accompanied with a makefile,
you can test each scenario with the corresponding make target.

Generally,
To compile: make or make run
Firstly start each sentinel server in a terminal: make run_sentinel_*** ('*' means there are multiple
targets to run sentinels)
Secondly start each exchange in a terminal: make run_exchange_***
Lastly, start the test client in a terminal: make run_client***
To clean generated class files: make clean
To kill background processes associated with this demo program: make kill

Note: in case of any exception saying "address is already in use", you need to change the "portNum"
in two places in the makefile to a different free port.

JGroups, a library for reliable and distributed messaging, is utilized in implementing this program.
